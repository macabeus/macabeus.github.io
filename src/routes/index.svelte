  <h1>Hi, I'm Macabeus! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a Sr. Full-Stack Engineer at OutSystems, building the runtime for a visual language that powers a
    robust low-code platform. In other words, my work is to develop the libraries used when running
    the application in the browser, as well as turning a visual language into JS.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned how to code using open sources projects, so I love helping them in different ways. I have
    several of my personal projects on GitHub, approaching different topics, including reverse engineering,
    compilers, and text editors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last but not least, I love developer communities, and I have been helping many of them for years now,
    both as an organizer and speaker.
  </p>
