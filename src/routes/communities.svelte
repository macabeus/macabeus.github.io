    <p>
      I'm the organizer of <strong>GambiConf</strong>, an event focused on Portuguese-speaking audiences inspired
      by <a href="https://bangbangcon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">!!Con</a> to bring the fun
      side of Computer Engineering â€” the one we usually won't learn and use in our day-to-day work.

    <p>
      Think of it as a place where the speakers can share unusual pet projects and mind-blowing stuff, like
      running DOOM in an oscilloscope or fluid computing.
