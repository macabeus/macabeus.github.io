  <h1>Hello, I'm Macabeus! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a Sr. Full-Stack Engineer at Anima, a startup company that improves the experience for designers and
    front-end developers by automating their workflows.<br />
    I work building plugins for design tools such as Figma and Adobe XD, as well as coding on our
    Python/Node backend.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned how to code by contributing to open-source projects, so I love helping them in different ways.
    I have several personal projects on GitHub, approaching different topics, including reverse engineering,
    compilers, and VS Code plugins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last but not least, I love developer communities, and I have been helping many of them for years now,
    both as an organizer and speaker.
  </p>
